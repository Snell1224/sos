/**
 * \brief Create an object index
 *
 * An index implements a persistent key/value store in an ODS data
 * store. The key is a generic obj_key_t and the value is an
 * obj_ref_t in the associated ODS object store. An ODS obj_ref_t can
 * be transformed back and forth between references and memory
 * pointers using the ods_obj_ref_to_ptr() and ods_obj_ptr_to_ref()
 * functions respectively.
 *
 * The 'type' parameter is the name of the type of index,
 * e.g. "BPTREE" or "RADIXTREE". This parameter identifies the
 * organization of the index and indirectly specifies the name of a
 * shared library that is loaded and implements the generic index
 * interface. There are convenience macros defined for the following
 * index types:
 *
 * - OBJ_IDX_BPTREE Implements a B+ Tree. The order of the tree is
 *   specifed in an 'order' parameter that follows the 'type'
 *   parameter. This parameter is only consulted if O_CREAT was
 *   specified and the index does not already exist.
 * - OBJ_IDX_RBTREE Implements a Red-Black Tree.
 * - OBJ_IDX_RADIXTREE Implements a Radix Tree.
 *
 * An index supports a untyped key that is an arbitrarily long
 * array of bytes. The application must specify the name of a 'key'
 * comparison function that compares two keys and returns the relative
 * order or equivalence of the keys. See the obj_key_t documentation
 * for more information. The 'key' parameter indirectly specifies the
 * name of a shared library that implements the key comparator
 * function. There are convenience macros defined for the predefined
 * key types. See the obj_key_t documention for the names and behavior
 * of these comparators.
 *
 * \param path	The path to the ODS store
 * \param mode	The file mode permission flags
 * \param type	The type of the index
 * \param key	The type of the key
 * \param ... Optional index type specific parameters
 *
 * \return 0	The index was successfully create. Use obj_idx_open()
 *		to access the index.

/**
 * \brief Implements the structure of an object key
 *
 * An object key is a counted array of bytes. A 'comparator'
 * abstraction is used to define the order and equivalence of two
 * keys. A comparator is defined by a name that indirectly
 * identifies a shared library that implements the comparator
 * function. There are a set of pre-defined comparator functions for
 * which there are convenience macros to specify their names as
 * follows:
 *
 * - OBJ_KEY_STRING The key is a string. The strncmp function is used
 *    to compare the two keys. If the lengths of the two keys is
 *    not equal, but they are lexically equal, the function returns the
 *    difference in length between the two keys.
 * - OBJ_KEY_INT32 The key is a 32b signed integer; the comparator returns
 *    key_a - key_b.
 * - OBJ_KEY_UINT32 The key is a 32b unsigned int; the comparator returns
 *    key_a - key_b.
 * - OBJ_KEY_INT64 The key is a 32b signed long; the comparator returns
 *    key_a - key_b.
 * - OBJ_KEY_UINT64 The key is a 64b unsigned long; the comparator returns
 *    key_a - key_b.
 *
 * These macros are used as parameters to the obj_idx_create()
 * function when the index is created.
