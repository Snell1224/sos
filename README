BUILD

In the simplest case, where all dependencies are in default
locations. Do the following in order to build:

# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type>

where <type> is one of DEBUG or RELEASE.

If you have installed the Zap transport in a private build location,
use the ZAP_PATH variable to inform CMake where to look. For example,

# cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -DZAP_PATH=/home/tom/build/ovis
